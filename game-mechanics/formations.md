# Formations

When you send out troops, you can choose how many infantries/cavalries/archers you will send.

Usually you'll send 1/3 each, but this is not optimal.

When defining a formation, usually you'll get a request like 50/30/20, meaning 50% infantry, 30% cavalry, 20% archers.

You can set these numbers when selecting troops, using the "Balance" button.

Example of a 40/40/20 formation:
