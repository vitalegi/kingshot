# Rallies

## Starting a rally

What the game uses:

- your stats boosts
- the troops you dispatch
- of each of the 3 heroes:
  - all their skills
  - all their equipments

For this reason, it is suggested to use the 3 strongest heroes you have, which usually involves also one of:

**Amadeus**

*Increase all Squads' total Lethality*

**Jabel**

## Joining a rally

In this case, the game will only consider:

- of the left-most hero: the top-right skill
- the troops you dispatch

The only time when sending more than one hero makes sense is when you need to increase the number of troops you can send to join a rally.
This becomes relevant usually when you're far ahead in the game, with 400k+ total troops available.

In general, it is suggested to use only 1 hero, and for that hero to be one of the following:

### Offensive Rally

**Yeonwoo**

*Increase all Squads' total Lethality*

**Chenko**

*Increase all Squads' total Lethality*

**Amane**
![](/static/heroes/amane-avatar.webp){width=150px height=150px}

*Increase all Squads' total Attack*

**Amadeus**
![](/static/heroes/amadeus-avatar.webp){width=150px height=150px}

*Increase all Squads' total Lethality*

If none of them is available, it's better to send no hero at all.

### Defensive Rally

**Gordon**

*Increase all Squads' total Health*

**Howard**

*Reduces all Squads' total damage taken*
